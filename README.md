This software only works on Windows and has yet only been tested on Windows 10, 8 & 7.

## Install
Setting up AssistantComputerControl is a _piece of cake!_ It only takes about 2 minutes. You just [download the latest version](http://acc.albe.pw/) to your computer, open it and the setup guide will take you through the very short setup guide!

_Note: [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) and a [Dropbox](https://www.dropbox.com/) account is required for the default setup. Dropbox will need to be running at all times for ACC to work_

## Adding actions
When the setup is done, all there's left to do is enable as many actions as you like! An "action" is executed on your computer, so enabling the "shutdown" action will allow you to shut down your computer using your assistant!

Scroll to the start of this article for a link-list of all the supported actions!
Or visit the ["Actions"](https://github.com/AlbertMN/HomeComputerControl/wiki/Actions) article in the Wiki for a more detailed look at what actions are, what they do and how they work.

If you want more freedom and set all of this up yourself you can do that! [Here](https://github.com/AlbertMN/AssistantComputerControl/wiki/Manual-setup) is a guide on how to manually set up the software (also fairly simple), which allows you to decide where the software is on your computer and much more.

For more nerdy technical info you can go to the [Wiki](https://github.com/AlbertMN/AssistantComputerControl/wiki) and take a look at the other articles as well.

So as you can see no coding is required! But if you're up for it and want to add your own features to the project it's easy! The entire project is made made in C# and the code is opensource and quite simple, so feel free to use the code in your own fork or even better; submit pull requests!
